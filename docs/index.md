# Hewa Swift Documentation

<!-- For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org). -->

## Introduction to Hewa Swift
In the Kenyan context, matatus are a common means of transport for the citizens. The air quality in public service vehicles in Kenya may pose threats to many passengers. As confirmed by our research this project seeks to improve the air quality in kenyan PSV using an automated IOT device.

## Documentation 
Below we have some of the documentation required for the Hewa Swift project

### Product Requirement Documentation

The PRD describes the product Hewa Swift will build. It drives the efforts of the entire Hewa Swift team.It is going to help the team identify the components needed to build the IOT device and all that is required to have the project working.


### System documentation 
This will give the team a better understanding of how the project works including the source code for 
us as the developers.

## Components needed 

#### MQ135 gas sensor
- Detects a wide range of gasses including smoke, CO2.

#### ESP 8266 node MCU Wifi Module
- Gives the microcontroller access to  your wifi network
SIM900A V4.0 GSM GPRS Module



#### Arduino Mega
- Develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash) 

#### DHT22 Temperature and humidity sensor
- DHT22 sensor provides accurate measurement up to 0.10C but a slower response in detecting temperature change. This finding would be able to provide a reference in developing an IoT system that requires temperature monitoring.

#### Breadboard
- Creating electrical connections between electronic components and single board computers such as arduino.

#### 10k potentiometer
- Changing the electrical parameters of the system.

#### 1k Ohm resistors
- Used to reduce current flow.

#### Power supply adapter 12v 2A
- It takes a 12-volt source and converts it to 2 amps of energy to power the device it is connected to.

#### 5V Relay
- A 5v relay is an automatic switch that is commonly used in an automatic control circuit and to control a high-current using a low-current signal.

#### Activated carbon 
- Filter + HEPA filter
- Traps 99.97% of small particles 0.3 microns and higher as well as most larger particles, especially spores.

#### PC fan
- One will help intake air into the vehicle. 
- The other will exhaust air out of the vehicle.

#### Jumper wires
- Used with breadboards and other prototyping tools in order to make it easy to change a circuit as needed.
